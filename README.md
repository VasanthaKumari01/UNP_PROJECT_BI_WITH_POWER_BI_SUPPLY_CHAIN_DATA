# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA

I have performed this project with UNP. The supply chain report provides an overview of product availability, customer purchasing behavior, supplier contributions, and transportation efficiency. It highlights the importance of optimizing logistics to reduce costs and improve delivery times. The analysis suggests a focus on high-value products and efficient transportation methods to enhance overall profitability. Additionally, it emphasizes the need for strategic decision-making based on past trends and real-time tracking to minimize delays and improve operational effectiveness.
